Testing framework for deploying OpenStack using Chef
====================================================

This is the testing framework for OpenStack deployed using `Chef`_. We
leverage this to test against our changes to our `cookbooks`_ to make
sure that you can still build a cluster from the ground up with any
changes we introduce.

This framework also gives us an opportunity to show different Reference
Architectures and a sane example on how to start with OpenStack using
Chef.

With the ``master`` branch of the cookbooks, which is currently tied to
the base OpenStack Train release, this supports deploying to Ubuntu
18.04 and CentOS 7 in monolithic, or allinone, and non-HA multinode
configurations with Neutron. The cookbooks support a fully HA
configuration, but we do not test for that as there are far numerous
paths to HA.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Chef 16 or higher
- `Chef Workstation`_ 21.10.640 or later
- `Vagrant`_ 2.0 or later with `VirtualBox>`_ or some other provider

.. _Chef Workstation: https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation/
.. _Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
.. _VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Getting the Code (this repo)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-chef.git
  $ cd openstack-chef

The OpenStack cookbooks by default use encrypted data bags for
configuring passwords. There are four data bags : ``user_passwords``,
``db_passwords``, ``service_passwords``, ``secrets``. There already
exists a ``data_bags/`` directory, so you shouldn't need to create any
for a proof of concept. If you do, something is wrong. See the
`Data Bags`_ section for the gory details.

Supported Deployments
---------------------

For each deployment model, there is a corresponding file in the ``doc/``
directory. Please review that for specific details and additional setup
that might be required before deploying the cloud.

Kitchen Deploy Commands
-----------------------

These commands will produce various OpenStack cluster configurations,
the simplest being a monolithic Compute Controller with Neutron
(allinone) which contains all supported cookbooks being deployed.

Due to memory constraints with our CI environment, we also have the
minimal suite which only tests keystone, glance, neutron, cinder and
nova. Running this suite should duplicate what we do in our CI pipeline.
We also have individual suites for each cookbook if you are just working
on a single cookbook and don't require the allinone suite.

These deployments are not intended to be production-ready, and will need
adaptation to your environment. This is intended for development and
proof of concept deployments.

Kitchen Test Scenarios
----------------------

Initialize Chef Workstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"

Everything self-contained (allinone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  # allinone with all supported cookbooks
  $ kitchen test "default-(centos|ubuntu)"

Access the machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ kitchen login [centos|ubuntu]
  $ sudo su -

Multiple nodes (non-HA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  # Multinode with Neutron (1 controller + 2 compute nodes)
  $ export KITCHEN_YAML=.kitchen.multi.yml
  $ kitchen converge [centos|ubuntu|all]
  $ kitchen verify [centos|ubuntu|all]
  $ kitchen destroy [centos|ubuntu|all]``

Access the Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ kitchen login controller-[centos|ubuntu]
  $ sudo su -

Access the Compute nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd vms
  $ kitchen login compute1
  # OR
  $ kitchen login compute2
  $ sudo su -

Testing The Controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

  # Access the controller as noted above
  $ source /root/openrc
  $ nova --version
  $ openstack service list && openstack hypervisor list
  $ openstack image list
  $ openstack user list
  $ openstack server list

Working With Security Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow SSH access to instances, a security group is defined as
follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack security group list
  $ openstack security group list default
  $ openstack security group create allow_ssh --description "allow ssh to instances"
  $ openstack security group rule create allow_ssh --protocol tcp --dst-port 22:22 --remote-ip 0.0.0.0/0
  $ openstack security group list allow_ssh

Working With Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow SSH keys to be injected into instance, a key pair is defined as
follows:

.. code-block:: console

  # generate a new key pair
  $ openstack keypair create mykey > mykey.pem
  $ chmod 600 mykey.pem
  $ openstack keypair create --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mykey
  # verify the key pair has been imported
  $ openstack keypair list

Booting up a cirros image on the Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack server create --flavor 1 --image cirros --security-group allow_ssh --key-name mykey test

Wait a few seconds and the run ``openstack server list`` if Status is
not Active, wait a few seconds and repeat.

Once status is active you should be able to log in using SSH, or
``vagrant ssh <vm_name>``

.. code-block:: console

  $ ssh cirros@<ip address from openstack server list output>

Accessing The OpenStack Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to use the OpenStack dashboard you should go to
https://localhost:9443 and the username and password is
``admin/mypass``.

Verifying OpenStack With Tempest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you log in to the ``controller`` machine you can test via the most
recent `Tempest`_ release.

.. _Tempest: https://opendev.org/openstack/tempest

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd vms
  $ vagrant ssh <controller>
  $ sudo su -
  root@controller:~ cd /opt/tempest
  root@controller:/opt/tempest$ ./run_tempest.sh -V --smoke --serial

  [-- snip --]

  tempest.tests.test_wrappers.TestWrappers
      test_pretty_tox                                                       1.68
      test_pretty_tox_fails                                                 1.03
      test_pretty_tox_serial                                                0.61
      test_pretty_tox_serial_fails                                          0.55

  Ran 233 tests in 13.869s

  OK
  Running flake8 ...

Cleanup
-------

To remove all the nodes and start over again with a different
environment or different environment attribute overrides, using the
following rake command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ chef exec rake destroy_machines

To refresh all cookbooks, use the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

  $ rm -rf cookbooks
  $ chef exec rake berks_vendor

To clean up everything, use the following rake command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ chef exec rake clean

Data Bags
---------

Some basic information about the use of data bags within this repo.

.. code-block:: console

  # Show the list of data bags
  $ chef exec knife data bag list -z
  db_passwords
  secrets
  service_passwords
  user_passwords

  # Show the list of data bag items
  $ chef exec knife data bag show db_passwords -z
  cinder
  dash
  glance
  horizon
  keystone
  neutron
  nova

  # Show contents of data bag item
  $ chef exec knife data bag show db_passwords nova -z
  Encrypted data bag detected, decrypting with provided secret.
  nova: mypass
  id:   nova

  # Update contents of data bag item
  # set EDITOR env var to your editor. eg. EDITOR=vi
  $ chef exec knife data bag edit secrets dispersion_auth_user -z

Data Bag Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``db_passwords`` are set to "mypass" secrets are set to
``token_service`` passwords are set to "mypass" ``user_passwords`` are
set to "mypass"

Default Encrypted Data Bag Secret
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default secret is stored here ``.chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret``
and referenced by ``.chef/knife.rb``.

When we say defaults, we mean that they are known by everyone with
access to this repository. Change these to something else before
deploying for real.

Known Issues and Workarounds
----------------------------

Windows Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using this on a Windows platform, here are some tweaks to make this
work:

- In order to get SSH to work, you will need an SSL client installed.
  You can use the one that comes with `Git for Windows`_. You will need
  to append ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;`` to the system PATH.

TODOs
-----

- Support for floating IPs
- Better instructions for multi-node network setup
- Easier debugging. Maybe a script to pull the logs from the controller.
