Supported Platforms
===================

The following operating systems and versions are supported by the OpenStack cookbooks:

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
* CentOS 7 or Stream 8

The cookbooks are tested and verified to work on the Chef stable track using
the `Chef Workstation <https://www.chef.sh/docs/chef-workstation/getting-started/>`_.

Your success rate may vary with the bleeding edge. Chef 15 and older is NOT
supported.

Have a look at
`OpenStack Chef Continuous Integration <https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-chef/latest/contributor/ci.html>`_
to see what is currently tested.
